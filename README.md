This Success After Prison Project was our first Pair Programming Project in the JTC program Fall/2021.

Written using Python 3 in Visual Code, using Django, HTML & CSS.

This code has been created based on all the concepts taught by JTC.

For example Creating files in the Django Program, Adding HTML Pages, Creating Style Sheet with CSS, and finally pushing, pulling and merging files through GitHub.

We were very excited in creating this wonderful app to assist all New York Residents who have been Recently Released and are Justice Impacted Persons to find helpful resources to assist with the most critical care information to reintegrate back into society.

It has been a fruitful experience working together and learning from one another.
