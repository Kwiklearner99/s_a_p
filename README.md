This Success After Prison Project was our first Pair Programming Project in the JTC program Fall/2021.

We created this app using Django, Python, HTML & CSS, the platform we used was Visual Code.

This code has been created based on all the concepts taught by Justice Through Code.

Once we had put together our vision for this app,  we created files in the Django Program, writing python code, Adding HTML Pages, Creating Style Sheet with CSS, and finally pushing, pulling and merging files through GitHub.

We were very excited in creating this wonderful app to assist all New York Residents who have been Recently Released and are Justice Impacted Persons to find helpful resources to assist with the most critical care information to reintegrate back into society.

We are very thankful for this amazing opportunity in being part of this cohort with these amazing ladies who all have a story to tell. We all felt we needed to give back to the ladies that will come after us who can see that our past mistakes have not defined who we are today.

There are four fully functional pages, beginning with the Home Page, Client Page, Resource Page and Blog Page.

Home Page is the welcoming page for all Returning Citizens to obtain useful information.

Client Page provides direct links to the Government ID website, Social Security Administration, Birth Certificate Assistance, Job Training, Housing Assistance, Medical Insurance, Clothing and Food Resources.

Resource Page provides the Federal Bonding Information website, Justice Through Code Program and many other links to provide a wealth of information to insure a successful rentry program made availbale to all Returning Citizens.

Blog Page provides a section where each Returning Citizen can provide their feedback on their experiences they've had with the resources we have provided and any additional feedback to provide us with additional information to continually grow and expand with our informative app.

It has been a fruitful experience, working together and learning from one another. 

We want to thank the JTC Group who has taken the time to teach us all these great tools to help us advance in our technical field.
